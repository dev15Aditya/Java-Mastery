# OOP Concepts in Java

1. Inheritance
- Inheritance allows a child class to inherit properties and behavior from a parent class.

2. Polymorphism
* Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)
- Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

* Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
- A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.

3. Abstraction
- Abstraction hides implementation details and only shows relevant data.

* Using Abstract Class
* Using Interface

4. Encapsulation
- Encapsulation is achieved using private fields and public getter/setter methods.
